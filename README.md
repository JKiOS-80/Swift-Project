# Vismoxx
Vismoxx visualizing the future.

We created the Vismoxx app with a single premise, to help you gain access to all these benefits and immerse yourself into the office layout creation process. Being able to see everything before the project is started makes it easy to adjust and adapt your ideas. Plus, you get to prevent situations when you would need to make changes to the project while everything is installed. If you always wanted to prepare renovations or interior design projects with ease and save a lot of money, then we encourage you to give the Vismoxx application a try today!

## Configuring Your Environment

1. Before progressing please make sure XCode is installed on your Mac

2. Check out the github repo

3. Please install [CocoaPods](https://guide.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html), a package manager for iOS apps. You can install CocoaPods by typing the following in your terminal.

     ```sudo gem install cocoapods```

4. ```cd``` to the folder where you checked out the github project and use the following command to make sure you have the latest packages and dependencies

     ```pod install```

5. Next, make sure to open the viome.xcworkspace otherwise XCode will not properly link the dependencies.

6. Finally, just hit the compile and run button in Xcode to build the app on your computer via the iOS Simulator.
